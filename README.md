# GameOfLife
A game of life implementation using ZIM.js

This app contains two files, one is displaying the generations and information in a basic way, this is the gameOriginal.html.
The index.html is the one that contains the code for the implementation using the fire and trees as alive and dead cells.



The main logic for the game was implemented using Concannon's write up at http://disruptive-communications.com/conwaylifejavascript/
